# OAuth2 client

## Update:
This repository is forked from danielsz/oauth2-client. I used this tool in my project and it is needed to add some little useful features so with adding them I think it is more friendly.
It is added exporting as jar file, reading credentials from properties file, and using custom token url features.
If you want export/import as jar, run "mvn package", and in covering project you can call easily with 2 lines of code:
ProtectedResourceManager manager = new ProtectedResourceManager(ProtectedResourceManager.client.getAccessToken());
String result = ProtectedResourceManager.fetch(ProtectedResourceManager.client, manager, nextId);

## Rationale

Java OAuth2 clients are plentiful. Oddly enough, they all seem to focus on the authorization code grant type. This library aims to provide a solution for the resource owner password grant type. 

## Usage

```java
import org.sdf.danielsz.OAuth2Client;
import org.sdf.danielsz.Token;

OAuth2Client client = new OAuth2Client("username", "password", "app-id", "app-secret", "site");
Token token = client.getAccessToken();

token.getResource(client, token, "/path/to/resource?name=value");
```
With this grant type, the client application doesn't need to store the username/password of the user. Those credentials are asked once and exchanged for an access token. This token can then be used to access protected resources. 

To check if a token has expired:

```java
token.isExpired();
```

To refresh a token:

```java
Token newToken = token.refresh(client);
```

### Real-life example

This example shows a fetch operation on a protected resource being repeated over time. If the token has expired, it is refreshed before the actual request is made. 

```java

import java.util.TimerTask;

public class ProtectedResourceManager {

	private static final OAuth2Client client = new OAuth2Client("username", "password", "app-id", "ap-secret", "site");
	private Token token;

	public Token getToken() {
		return token;
	}

	public void setToken(Token token) {
		this.token = token;
	}

	public ProtectedResourceManager(Token token) {
		this.token = token;
	}

	public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {

		ProtectedResourceManager manager = new ProtectedResourceManager(client.getAccessToken());
		MyTimerTask timer = manager.new MyTimerTask();
		java.util.Timer t = new java.util.Timer();
		t.schedule(timer, 5000, 1200000);
	}

	public static void fetch(OAuth2Client client, ProtectedResourceManager manager) {
		Token token = manager.getToken();
		if (token.isExpired()) manager.setToken(token.refresh(client));		
		manager.getToken().getResource(client, manager.getToken(), "/api/resource?name=value");
	}

	class MyTimerTask extends TimerTask {

		public void run() {
			fetch(client, ProtectedResourceManager.this);
		}
	}
}

```

### Contributions

I welcome all contributions insofar as they remain in the realm of the resource owner password grant type. 

### Acknowledgments

The public API of this library was inspired by Ruby's OAuth2 [library](https://github.com/intridea/oauth2). 
The IBM developerWorks [article](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/security/library/se-oathjavapt1/index.html) on the subject of this particular grant type was very helpful, too.
